# MIPS Assembly Labs

## Overview
This repository contains multiple labs focusing on MIPS assembly programming concepts. Each lab covers different aspects of assembly programming through exercises and examples.

## Labs
1. **Basic Instructions**  
   Covers basic MIPS instructions, including addition, subtraction, and memory handling.

2. **Control Flow**  
   Introduces control flow structures like conditional statements and loops.

3. **Arrays**  
   Explores array implementation and processing.

4. **Procedures**  
   Demonstrates the use of procedures and calling conventions in MIPS.

5. **Recursion**  
   Focuses on recursion in MIPS assembly.

6. **I/O and Strings**  
   Covers input/output and string manipulation.

## Usage
Each lab contains `.asm` files that can be executed using a MIPS simulator, such as MARS or SPIM.

## Instructions
- Open the `.asm` file in a MIPS simulator.
- Assemble and run the code to observe the behavior.
